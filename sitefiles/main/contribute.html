            <p>
                1. Help in translation work <br>

                2. Help in image to text converison work

                Help in translation work
                
                So the first way is to help in translation works. I am planning on creating both english and malayalam versions of the website. So in order to do that all the contents must be tanslated to english from malayalam, and english to malayalam. Though I am pretty much proficient in english I am not much proficient in grammer. Moreover a huge chunk of data is waiting to be translated . Hemce it will take a lot of time for me to succesfully translate it and for that reason I need help for translation purpose. I am looking for volunteers and not for payed employees... So if snyone is interested please contact me.


                Help in image to text converison work

                So the other option is to help me in image to text conversion work. There is a lot of digital content as well as books and offline articles for me to include in this site. Hence as there is also a big load of offline contents ( articles from different books and stuff...) I need help in converting them into digital items. You could either use softwares or type manually. I will be giving things in image format for you to convert. If you are interested in that work then contact me as well. So once again I am looking for volunteers not paid employees :>.

                and basically these are the only ways fir you to contribute in this project. If you are interested ping me in gmail,instagram or fb... Thanks for now...
